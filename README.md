# matlab toolbox
A collection of miscellaneous matlab codes written (or forked) by myself. Below is the list of functions,
## (1) Signal Processing
  - compute_area : computes area bounded by the curve 
  - compute_aoc  : computes Area Over Curve
  - compute_auc  : computes Area Under Curve
## (2) Matrix Operations
  - trf_triu2vec : vectorizes upper triangular part of a matrix
  - trf_vec2triu : converts the given vector into a symmetric, square matrix
