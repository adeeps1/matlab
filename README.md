# MM : miscellaneous matlab codes
A collection of scripts written (or forked) by myself. Below is the list of functions,
## (1) Signal Processing
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `compute_area` | computes area bounded by the curve |
| `compute_aoc`  | computes Area Over Curve |
| `compute_auc`  | computes Area Under Curve |
## (2) Matrix Operations
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `trf_triu2vec` | vectorizes upper triangular part of a matrix |
| `trf_vec2triu` | converts the given vector into a symmetric, square matrix |
| `trf_vech` | performs half-vectorization of a given matrix |
| `trf_ivech` | performs the inverse operation of `trf_vech` |
## (3) Data Processing
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `check_spdmats` | returns a 3d array of symmetric and positive semidefinite matrices |
