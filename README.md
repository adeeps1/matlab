# matlab toolbox
A collection of miscellaneous matlab codes written (or forked) by myself. Below is the list of functions,
## (1) Signal Processing
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `compute_area` | computes area bounded by the curve |
| `compute_aoc`  | computes Area Over Curve |
| `compute_auc`  | computes Area Under Curve |
## (2) Matrix Operations
  - trf_triu2vec  : vectorizes upper triangular part of a matrix
  - trf_vec2triu  : converts the given vector into a symmetric, square matrix
## (3) Data Processing
  - check_spdmats : returns a 3d array of symmetric and positive semidefinite matrices
